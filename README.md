# REBALANCE Finance: Interest Vault Contracts

This is the repository of smart contracts for interest rebalancing. The system allows automatic redistribution of funds between various liquidity providers to maximize yield.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following main components:

- **Vault** - base vault contract with ERC4626 support
- **Rebalancer** - contract for rebalancing between providers
- **RebalancerWithRewards** - extended version with rewards support
- **VaultManager** - manager for managing multiple vaults
- **Timelock** - contract for secure governance with delay
- **RewardsDistributor** - rewards distributor with Merkle proof
- **ProviderManager** - liquidity provider manager

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Testing

```bash
npx hardhat test
