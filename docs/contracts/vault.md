# Vault

Base vault contract implementing the ERC4626 standard for asset management and interaction with liquidity providers.

**File:** `contracts/base/Vault.sol`

## Overview

Vault is the central component of the REBALANCE Finance system. It inherits from ERC4626 and provides functionality for:
- User deposits and withdrawals
- Conversion between assets and shares
- Interaction with liquidity providers
- Fee and settings management

## Constructor

```solidity
constructor(
    address asset_,
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    IProvider[] memory providers_,
    uint256 withdrawFeePercent_,
    address timelock_,
    address treasury_
)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `asset_` | `address` | Address of the underlying asset (ERC20 token) |
| `name_` | `string` | Vault token name |
| `symbol_` | `string` | Vault token symbol |
| `providers_` | `IProvider[]` | Array of liquidity providers |
| `withdrawFeePercent_` | `uint256` | Withdrawal fee percentage (maximum 5%) |
| `timelock_` | `address` | Timelock contract address |
| `treasury_` | `address` | Treasury address |

### Limitations

- `withdrawFeePercent_` cannot exceed 5% (`MAX_WITHDRAW_FEE_PERCENT`)
- `asset_`, `timelock_`, `treasury_` cannot be zero addresses
- Vault is initially paused for deposits until setup is completed

## Security

### Protection against inflation attacks

### Fee limitations
- Maximum withdrawal fee: 5%
- Maximum rebalancing fee: 20%

### Pausing operations
Individual operations can be paused for emergency response.

### Role-based access
Critical operations are restricted to Admin and Timelock roles.
